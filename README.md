In this repository, I am going to use the movie app I created in the previous checkpoint and afterward, use the router library to route our views.

Instructions

We will add a description and the trailer link (embed video link) to the object movie.
Every time I click on a movie card, it will take me to the movie description and trailer page.
In the description page, I can navigate back to the home page.
